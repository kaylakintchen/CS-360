# CS-360

This application was designed to be a simple event tracker. It was created to help people stay organized and remind people of their events. I only created four screens, the log in screen, main event list, add event page which doubled as the page to edit event events, and the request permissions page. In creating these pages, I made sure to follow android industry guidelines to ensure my designs were successful. 
To code my app, I developed one feature from start to completion before moving to the next feature. This simplified the process and kept me organized. In the editing function, I needed to innovate to overcome a bug. I learned a lot about using logcat to debug my application. In my event list view, I feel I best demonstrated my knowledge of android studio
